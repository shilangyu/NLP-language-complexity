Kubuxu,Go,"go-multicodec uses `/json` as an example, spec says `/json/`.

@dignifiedquire could you take a look at what js-multicodec is using?

Kubuxu,Go,"For dev purposes, it is good to have a range of valid codecs that can be used for developing support for new protocols. I think we had something like that in the past but I can't find it in the table right now."
